# Oz Election
R functions to scape two party first preference and two party preferred results.

I haven't got ```GetBoothFP()``` function to work yet.

I have added the following functions, based on Michael's work:

Returns the two-party preferred results from the AEC website for the seat of interest

```
Get2CP()
```

Returns all first preference results for each party for a seat of interest
```
GetAllCP()
```
